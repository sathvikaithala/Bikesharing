# Bike Sharing Proposal for Des Moines, Iowa
UC Berkeley Extension Data Analytics Boot Camp Module 14

#### Looking at the viability of starting a bike sharing program in Des Moines, IA.

---

### Overview

We were tasked with putting together an investor presentation to pitch the viability of a bike share program in Des Moines, Iowa. 

We used data from a successful bike share program, Citi Bike in New York City, to determine whether a bike sharing program is replicable in Des Moines.

### Presentation Overview

In our presentation (linked [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sathvik.aithala#!/vizhome/DesMoinesBikeShare/Story?publish=yes)), we hoped to answer a few questions:

- What is the best part of town to focus our bike sharing program in? When are our bikes most likely to be used, and when can we perform any required maintenance on them?
- Who is our target demographic?
- Which payment structure would be most profitable in Des Moines? Individual-use tickets, or annual subscriptions?

### Findings

- We used a dataset from the [Citi Bike NYC website](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) for the month of August, 2019. 
  - In our research, we found that most of the bike rentals happened near the business district in Manhattan.
  - We also found that the peak rental hours are between 5-7PM, which correlate with the times most people leave the office.
  
    - <b>Our findings suggest that our bike share program should be centered in the business district. </b>

- We used the [US Census website](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,desmoinescityiowa/PST045219) to determine the demographics of both NYC and Des Moines to see if they were comparable. 
  - Both cities have a similar gender ratio and age demographics, with Des Moines being better suited for a bike share program based on the findings from our New York dataset.
  - Des Moines has a slightly higher male population than NYC. In our data, we found that males are more likely to rent bikes.
  - We found that Des Moines has a younger population as well, which correlates with longer rentals. 
  
    - <b>Through our research, we found that our target demographic is young males who work near the business district.</b>

- In order to determine the ideal pay structure for our service, we looked at the tourism industries in both Des Moines and NYC. We used the [Des Moines City Tourism Calendar](http://www.dmcityview.com/calendar/) to determine the relative tourist activity in Des Moines compared to NYC.
  - We found that NYC is has a much bigger tourism industry than Des Moines.
  - We found that even in NYC, most of the bike share customers are using annual subscriptions.
  - We concluded that Des Moines is likely to have a higher percentage of annual subscriptions than NYC.
  
    - <b>This suggests that our customers are more likely to be local rather than tourists, which tells us to focus our advertising efforts on our annual subscription model rather than single-use rentals.</b>
